      <p><b><span>No, social media and AI are not inherently bad; however, as they become increasingly present in our lives, it’s important to be aware of how they function and of what they are capable of.</span></b> It’s easy to forget that, behind the big social networking platforms you use daily, a series of algorithms, design elements, and more are all dedicated to getting you to spend as much time as possible on the app. Today, the root of so many alarming problems - whether it be snowballing conspiracy theories, the propagation of harmful and dangerous ideologies, or more - lies in the algorithms of some of the world's most prominent social networks. This does not mean that these tech companies intend for their algorithms to have these effects, but rather that there are negative consequences to using a system designed to facilitate a site in making money without sufficient regulation in terms of how this could affect its community. </p>

          <p>This 2020 docudrama directed by Jeff Orlowski raises awareness on the dangers of social networking online. Throughout the film, several tech experts (many of which have played important roles in developping key elements of some of the biggest networking sites) help explain how algorithms behind social media platforms distort reality, how users are monitered and manipulated by these same platforms, how society as a whole is shaped by them, how social media is designed so as promote addiction, and so on.</p>
