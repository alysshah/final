        <blockquote>The classic saying is: “If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product.” A lot of people think, you know, “Oh, well, Google’s just a search box, and Facebook’s just a place to see what my friends are doing and see their photos.” But what they don’t realize is they’re competing for your attention.</blockquote>

        <div class="section-title">SOME CASES TO LOOK AT</div>
        <p><b>PIZZAGATE</b></p>
        <p>This conspiracy theory emerged in 2016, when the emails of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, were leaked. One of these emails was exchange between him and the owner of a D.C. pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong. Following this, several 4Chan users started claiming that this pizzeria was actually the location of a child trafficking ring and that ordering a pizza was code for ordering a trafficked child. This quickly spread to Facebook, where the algorithm started recommending Pizzagate groups to users. Facebook would look at the groups they were already part of, and, if, for example, they were a member of anti-vax groups or conspiracy theory groups, they would identity them as being more prone to believing (and therefore being interested in) Pizzagate. With the elections approaching, this conspiracy became very politically charged, and it eventually gave way to violence: in December, Edgar Maddison Welch showed up to the pizzeria with an assault riffle (which he fired before being stopped by police, but without injuring anyone) as well as other weapons. Additionally, he had hit a teenage pedestrian with his car on his way there, severely injuring him. This theory was debunked, but still ended up resurfacing recently, in 2020.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>MYANMAR</b></p>
        <p>In Myanmar, the Internet is usually associated with Facebook due to the fact that, when people there buy smartphones, Facebook is typically preloaded onto them, account ready and all. Members of the Myanmar military decided to use this platform to carry out a campaign targetting the Muslim Rohingya people, a minority within the country. Flooding the platform with hate speech, the miliraty personnel hid behind fake fan accounts and such to propagate fake news and incited murder, arson, and genocide. They took advantage of Facebook's wide reach in the country and successfully weaponized the platform, causing hundreds or thousands of Rohingya Muslims to flee.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="section-title">WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</div>
        <p>While these two preceding cases are extreme and can absolutely not be said to have been entirely caused by Facebook or any one person or party, they still serve to show the power that social media can have as well as the consequences that small and seemingly insignifcant parts of an algorithm can cause. Additionally, the fact that Facebook inadvertently takes advantage of people who they belive are more prone to believing any information thrown their waay is alarming.</p>

        <blockquote>If I want to manipulate an election, I can now go into a conspiracy theory group on Facebook, and I can find 100 people who believe that the Earth is completely flat and think it’s all this conspiracy theory that we landed on the moon, and I can tell Facebook, ‘Give me 1,000 users who look like that.’ Facebook will happily send me thousands of users that look like them that I can now hit with more conspiracy theories.</blockquote>

        <div class="section-title">HISTORY OF FACEBOOK'S ALGORITHM AND WHAT IT SHOWS</div>
        <p>When Mark Zuckerberg first started coding what would become one of the world’s most popular social networking sites, Facebook was only an online directory for Harvard students. Besides being a campus-wide social network, there were no other uses for the site; there was no need for an algorithm to rank and display posts as the one it uses today does. This is mainly because Facebook had no ads (which Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker insisted was the very element that made the platform “cool”): it was not an advertising model, and, consequently, the amount of time you spent on the network or how you spent it could not have mattered less to the company. It was all about the number of accounts, how far the network spread, whether they had reached more universities and eventually continents, etc. Of course, this did not last very long. </p>
        <p>Today, Facebook’s revenue largely comes from selling advertising space (other than from owning other platforms such as Oculus VR and WhatsApp); in fact, they started doing so back in 2004, only months after launching the social media site, to “offset the cost of the servers”, as Zuckerberg had told the Harvard Crimson. At this point in time, these very simple ad spaces were called “Facebook Flyers”, but were re-envisioned and modified numerous times since then. Some of these updates include:
          <ul>
            <li>2007: the creation of a full platform, Facebook Ads, where businesses could create their own profiles and interact with users</li>
            <li>2011: the release of the desktop program “Sponsored Stories”, which allowed ads to be placed directly in users’ feed</li>
            <li>2012: the launch of an ad program for their mobile app, which previously was not making money</li>
            <li>2016: the introduction of chatbots for advertisers to use on Messenger</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>By all appearances, <b>monetisation is the main incentive for influential social media companies to rely on a system that maximizes watch time or clicks or orients a user towards posts that they will be more likely to interact with.</b></p>

        <blockquote>Facebook conducted what they called ‘massive-scale contagion experiments.’ How do we use subliminal cues on the Facebook pages to get more people to go vote in the midterm elections? And they discovered that they were able to do that. One thing they concluded is that we now know we can affect real-world behavior and emotions without ever triggering the user’s awareness. They are completely clueless.</blockquote>
